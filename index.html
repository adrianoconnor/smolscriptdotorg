<div class="md:flex mt-4 flex-col lg:flex-row">

      <div class="mx-5 basis-full lg:basis-5/6 md:pr-10">

        <h5 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold bg-slate-200 inline-block px-2 py-1">about</h5>

        <p class="py-3">SmolScript is a mini programming laguage and runtime. It is based on a simple version of Javascript,
          it features a tiny compiler and VM, and it is very easy to embeded in dotnet and Javascript applications.</p>

        <p class="py-3">The VM provides some nice interactive debugging features, making it great for building educational
          programming apps and, because it is based on Javascript, it is a great teaching language.
        </p>

        <p class="py-3">It is not fast, it is not fancy, but it is very smol.</p>


        <h5 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold bg-slate-200 inline-block px-2 py-1">_why?</h5>

        <p class="py-3">There are lots of reasons why you might want a small embedded language. I had these
          reasons in mind when I started the project:</p>

        <div class="px-8">
          <ul role="list" class="list-disc">
            <li>Add scripting support to existing applications</li>
            <li>Use it to power educational programming language tools</li>
            <li>Be small and compact</li>
            <li>Learn/teach how compilers work</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="text-lg mt-12 lg:ml-5 p-5 basis-full lg:basis-1/3">
        <div class="border-gray-300 border-2 bg-slate-100 px-5 py-2 text-base" style="box-shadow:6px 6px #ace">
       <p class="my-2">SmolScript was created as a learning project.</p><p class="my-1">Everything I  
        know about compilers was learned from the amazing book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com" class="text-blue-600 underline">Crafting
        Interpreters</a>, so if you're also interested in learning how programming languages are created, that
        is the book for you. It's even free to read online.</p>
