    <p class="py-3">
      To start using SmolScript in your web browser, you only need to include one smolscript js file:
    </p>

    <div class="bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-600 p-1 text-sm">
{% highlight html %}
<script src="https://smolscript.org/smolscript-v0.3b.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>

    <p class="py-3">
      I strongly recommend downloading a copy of this file and hosting it alongside your app.
    </p>

    <p class="py-3">
      This gives you a SmolScript object in the global namescape. Initialize and run a simple smol script like this:
    </p>

    <div class="bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-600 p-1 text-sm">
{% highlight js %}
var exampleSmolScriptCode = @"

// This is the smol script program, not .net
var a = 10;

function multiplyA(valueToMultiplyBy) {
a = a * valueToMultiplyBy;
}

multiplyA(10);
";

var vm = SmolScript.SmolVM.Compile(exampleSmolScriptCode);

vm.run();

var valueOfA = vm.getGlobalVar("a");
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>

    <p class="py-3">
      We're creating a string that contains our smol program code, and then creating a VM by compiling the code. Once
      we've
      compiled, if there are no errors, we can .run() the VM to execute the entire program once.
    </p>
    <p class="py-3">
      On the last line of this sample, once the program has finished running and control is back in our code,
      we're getting the value of global variable 'a' from the VM. We only really support a few simple types, but
      because Smol types 'use' Javascript variables as the underlying types, it's more flexible and than .net.
    </p>

    <p class="py-3">
      This is just a very quick getting started sample. You can call Smol functions from your Javascript apps, and you
      can register JS functions to call from SmolScript. More documentation and samples coming soon.
    </p>
