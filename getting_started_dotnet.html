        <h2 class="md:hidden">Getting Started</h2>

        <h5 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold bg-slate-200 inline-block px-2 py-1">.net 6.0 + </h5>

        <p class="py-3">
        We only support dotnet core versions 6 and up. It would be pretty easy to add support for .net 4 I suspect, but
        it is definitely not on our roadmap.
        </p>
        <p class="py-3">
        To start using SmolScript in your project, add the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SmolScript/#versions-body-tab" class="text-blue-600 underline">smolscript nuget</a> either though the VS package manager or one the command line with <span class="font-mono text-sm bg-slate-100">dotnet add smolscript</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="py-3">
        Initialize and run a simple smol script like this:
        </p>

        <div class="border bg-slate-100 p-1">
{% highlight csharp %}
using SmolScript;

var exampleSmolScriptCode = @"

  // This is the smol script program, not .net
  var a = 10;

  function multiplyA(valueToMultiplyBy) {
    a = a * valueToMultiplyBy;
  }

  multiplyA(10);
";

var vm = SmolVM.Compile(exampleSmolScriptCode);

vm.Run();

var valueOfA = vm.GetGlobalVar<int>("a");
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

        <p class="py-3">
          We're creating a string that contains our smol program code, and then creating a VM by compiling the code. Once we've
          compiled, if there are no errors, we can .Run() the VM to execute the entire program once.
        </p>
        <p class="py-3">
          On the last line of this sample, once the program has finished running and control is back in our .net code,
          we're getting the value of global variable 'a' from the VM and casting it to int. Currently
          only a handful of primptive casts are supported (string, int, double, bool).
        </p>

        <p class="py-3">
          This is just a very quick getting started sample. You can call Smol functions from .net, and you can register .net functions to call from SmolScript. More documentation and samples coming soon.
        </p>
