        <h5 class="mt-8 text-lg font-bold">roadmap</h5>

        <p class="py-3">SmolScript is a mini programming laguage and runtime. It is based on simple Javascript, it features 
          a tiny compiler and VM that and can be easily embeded in dotnet and Javascript applications.</p>

        <p class="py-3">Our VM provides some interactive debugging features, making it great for building interactive educational
          apps and, because it is based on Javascript, it is a great learning language.
        </p>

        <p class="py-3">It is not fast, it is not fancy, but it is very smol.</p>


        <h5 class="mt-8 text-lg font-bold">why?</h5>

        <p class="py-3">There are lots of reasons why you would want to embed a scripting language, but I had a few
          specific things in mind when I built this:</p>

        <div class="px-8">
          <ul role="list" class="list-disc">
            <li>Let users write scripts for extending big complicated products without needing lots of custom code
              changes or feature flags</li>
            <li>To be used as a simple game engine scripting language, for running in a browser based editor</li>
            <li>A way to build custom logic blocks for low-code app environments</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="text-lg md:ml-5 p-5 basis-1/4">
        <div class="border-gray-300 border-2 bg-slate-200 px-5 py-2 text-base rounded-lg">
        SmolScript was created as a learning project. Everything I  
        know about compilers was learned from the amazing book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com" class="text-blue-600 underline">Crafting
        Interpreters</a>, so if you're also interested in learning how programming languages are created, that
        is the book for you. It's even free to read online!

        <h4 class="mt-3">Roadmap</h4>

        <p>v0.3 (September 2023)<br />This version will bring feature parity between the .net and JS codebases,
           plus basic debug symbols for much nicer interactive debugging.
