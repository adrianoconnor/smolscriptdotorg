    <h2 class="md:hidden">Roadmap</h2>
    <h5 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold bg-slate-200 inline-block px-2 py-1">coming soon</h5>

    <p class="py-3">We're still in the early phases of this project so things change fast. It's agile! This is our
      current roadmap for the next version:</p>

    <p class="py-1">
    <ul role="list" class="list-disc ml-5">
      <li>Better debug symbols</li>
      <li>Step-through debugging linked to symbols</li>
      <li>'console' added to the standard-library (for console.log)</li>
      <li>Better error messages</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="py-3">As you might be able to tell, these features are related to getting a better
      experience for the interactive demo on the website</p>

    <p class="py-3">Currently the .net and JS/TS versions are roughly in-sync. Sometimes one version gets
      a little bit ahead of the other. We expect the improved debugging features to be in the JS version first.
    </p>


    <h5 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold bg-slate-200 inline-block px-2 py-1">possible for future releases</h5>

    <p class="py-3">The following version are things we'd like to add soon, but we have not yet committed to:</p>

    <p class="py-1">
    <ul role="list" class="list-disc ml-5">
      <li>Interactive mode when execution paused (and also a REPL)</li>
      <li>Some modern JS syntax/features</li>
      <li>More standard library classes and functions (Date, JSON, numbers etc)</li>
      <li>Support for passing JSON or arbitrary objects to/from the host</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h5 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-lg font-bold bg-slate-200 inline-block px-2 py-1">not coming soon</h5>

    <p class="py-3">The following features are not on our roadmap right now, but we know people might want them one day:
    </p>

    <p class="py-1">
    <ul role="list" class="list-disc ml-5">
      <li>Async/Await</li>
      <li>Import/require modules</li>
      <li>Better performance</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="py-3">Please remember this is a hobby project. We prioritise simplicity and compactness over performance
      and features.</p>
